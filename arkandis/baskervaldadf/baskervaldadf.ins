  - The commentary in the original is deleted in this version. For 
  information about the \encName{} etc., typeset the original \baseFileName{} 
  included with fontinst.
  - Slots are altered to accommodate characters which are named 
  differently. For example, this encoding uses "endash" and "emdash" 
  whereas \baseFileName{} called for "rangedash" and "punctdash".
  - Empty slots may be used to accommodate different characters, especially
  ligatures.
  - If the encoding is intended for specialised use, available characters may
  be ignored in favour of alternates and/or ligatures.
