1. the Electrum ADF Exp fonts developed by Hirwen Harendel, Arkandis Digital
Foundry (ADF) and released under the terms set out in the files COPYING and
NOTICE.txt in postscript type 1 format;
2. (La)TeX support by Clea F. Rees released under the LPPL. All files covered
by the LPPL are listed in the file manifest.txt.

Information and resources concerning Electrum ADF, including opentype versions

## (La)TeX Support

For details, please see electrumadf.pdf.

The (La)TeX support requires nfssext-cfr and xkeyval. These packages are
available from CTAN.

The (La)TeX support should be considered somewhat experimental. If you find
any problems, please let me know and I will try to correct them. If you can
send a fix, so much the better.

## Code Repositories

Code for the LaTeX support package is hosted at 
	https://codeberg.org/cfr/nfssext
For convenience, the repository is mirrored at
  https://github.com/cfr42/nfssext

## Contact Details

Bug reports, feature requests etc. concerning the LaTeX support or packaging
should be filed at
  https://codeberg.org/cfr/nfssext/issues

If you have comments about the fonts themselves, please contact Hirwen
Harendal (harendalh <at> hotmail <dot> com).
