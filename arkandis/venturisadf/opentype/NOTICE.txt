Fonts 
-----

The Venturis Collection consists of fonts made by Arkandis Digital Foundry
(ADF), collectively known as the "Software", currently maintained by ADF.  As
the Software is modified from Utopia fonts, they are under the same license as
the Utopia fonts themselves (see LICENSE-utopia.txt).  That is, Akandis Digital
Foundry hereby grants the TeX Users Group and any and all other interested
parties the rights enumerated in the Utopia license.

As Venturis is a trademark of Arkandis Digital Foundry, any modified versions
of Software shall not use the font name(s) or trademark(s), in whole or in
part, unless explicit written permission is granted by ADF as described in the
initial license.

The following changes have been made to the standard Venturis Collection font
files in preparing this package for use with (La)TeX:
- the postscript versions of the fonts have been renamed according to the Karl
  Berry fontname scheme;
- the opentype fonts have been removed from the TeX package.
