This file should be installed somewhere that your DVI
to postscript driver looks for files. It is needed for
reencoding some font you have transformed.

After installing this file, you should add the following

\bspre declarepsencoding{\baseETX}{fontinst-autoenc-\baseETX}{\bspre download{\baseETX}}
