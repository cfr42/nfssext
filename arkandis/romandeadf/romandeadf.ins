  - The commentary in the original is deleted in this version. For 
  information about the \encName{} etc., typeset the original \baseFileName{} 
  included with fontinst.
  - Slots are altered to accommodate characters which are named 
  differently. For example, this encoding uses "endash" and "emdash" 
  whereas \baseFileName{} called for "rangedash" and "punctdash".
  - The original notices at the top of that file concerning authors,
  maintenance etc. are replaced by this notice.
  - The file is renamed.
  - The encoding name is modified.
  - f_f, f_f_i and f_f_l replace ff, ffi and ffl.
