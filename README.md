nfssext-cfr and LaTeX font packages

This is a collection of related LaTeX packages which all provide
support for fonts on 8-bit engines. Most packages also include fonts.
In these cases, the licensing is mixed. While the LaTeX support files
are licensed under the LPPL 1.3c, the fonts themselves generally have a 
different license. Details are included separately for each package.
All the fonts meet standard criteria for free software and are included
in both TeX Live and downstream packages prepared by Debian, Fedora etc.
